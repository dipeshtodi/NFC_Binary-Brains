                Tax Deduction
                Tax deductions are specific items that can be deducted from your income. These items are generally expenses or payments made towards certain investments.

                Tax Exemption
                Tax exemptions are specific items that are excluded from taxation. These items are generally allowances or other amounts earned as income.

              <h2>Tax Deduction
                .</h2>
              <p>
                When the eligible amounts are deducted from your income, your total taxable income comes down. As a result, the amount of tax that you need to pay is also reduced. All in all, you enjoy the benefit of reduced taxes when you claim tax deductions.
                For instance, say you are eligible to claim ₹40,000 as a tax deduction under the Income Tax Act, 1961. And say your total income is ₹4,30,000. After claiming the tax deduction, your total tax deduction would be ₹3,90,000

                Some examples of tax deductions include:
                Specific investments under Section 80C, like Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificate, and premium for life insurance
                Payment of health insurance premium under section 80D
                Specified donations made under section 80GInterest received on the amount in your savings account, as per section 80TTA

              <h2>Tax Exemption</h2>
              <p>
                These items are essentially tax-free. So, you do not have to pay taxes on such income at all. Some kinds of income may be partially exempt from tax, while others may be completely tax-free.
                
                For instance, say your total income for a financial year comes up to ₹1,40,000. And in addition to this, you earn an income of ₹20,000 under a head that is tax-free. In this case, your total taxable income will continue to be just ₹1,40,000 (and not ₹1,60,000), because that extra ₹20,000 is exempt from tax
